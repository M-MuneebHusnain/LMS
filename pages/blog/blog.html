				An integrated development environment or IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. There are many IDEs available in the market, the most commonly used IDEs are mentioned below.
				
				<br>
				
				<br>1. Microsoft Visual Studio code
				
				<br>Microsoft Visual Studio Code is the most widely used and popular IDE. It is Microsoft developed and includes tools and extensions for various computer languages such as C #, C ++, Python, PHP, etc. JavaScript, TypeScript, NodeJS, and many more. VS Code supports IntelliSense, which provides intelligent code recommendations via innovative code completion tools.
				
				<br>Visual Studio Code includes integrated GitHub, automatic testing tools, and syntax highlighting. The integrated debugger of VS code is suitable as both a machine-level and single-level debugger. VS Code also has plugin support, which means you can extend its features by adding a version control system, a new toolkit editor, and domain-specific language designers.
				
				<br><br>
				
				2. Eclipse
				
				<br>Eclipse is one of the best community-driven IDEs. It is an extensible platform with a GUI (Graphical User Interface) builder and a collection of tools, including tools for modeling, diagramming, testing, and reporting. The plugin development environment (PDE) also lets you create your plugins to extend the functionalities of Eclipse. It is written in Java but Python plugin can also be installed. 
				
				<br>This IDE is free and open-source and has several highly customizable and user-friendly extensions. Eclipse features are a Fast compiler, a large selection of plugins, Code refactoring, Support for multiple languages, and Automatic validation of syntax.
				
				<br><br>
				
				3. Spyder
				
				<br>
				Spyder is another good open-source and cross-platform IDE written in Python. It is also called Scientific Python Development IDE and it is the most lightweight IDE for Python. It is mainly used by data scientists who can integrate with Matplotlib, SciPy, NumPy, Pandas, Cython, IPython, SymPy, and other open-source software. It comes with the Anaconda package manager distribution and it has some good advanced features such as edit, debug, and data exploration. Below are some other features of this IDE.

                Computer Hardware: Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer. Computer Hardware is any part of the computer that we can touch these parts. These are the primary electronic devices used to build up the computer. Examples of hardware in a computer are the Processor, Memory Devices, Monitor, Printer, Keyboard, Mouse, and the Central Processing Unit. 
				
				<br>Computer Software: Software is a collection of instructions, procedures, and documentation that performs different tasks on a computer system. we can say also Computer Software is a programming code executed on a computer processor. The code can be machine-level code or the code written for an operating system. Examples of software are Ms Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Google Chrome, Photoshop, MySQL, etc.

                    You don’t want to waste your time. If you’re going to put aside the time and energy needed to learn new programming languages, you want to make sure, without a doubt, that the ones you choose are the most in-demand programming languages on the market.
					
					<br>After all, if you’re trying to start (or advance) a career in software development, you’ll need to be at the front of the metaphorical class. You’ll need to know which programming languages are popular, which are useful and which are up-and-coming on the market — and then set yourself up to learn them.
					<br><br>1. JavaScript
					<br>What this language is used for:
					<br>• Web development
					<br>• Game development
					<br>• Mobile apps
					<br>• Building web servers
					
					<br><br>According to Stack Overflow’s 2020 Developer Survey, JavaScript currently stands as the most commonly-used language in the world (69.7%), followed by HTML/CSS (62.4%), SQL (56.9%), Python (41.6%) and Java (38.4%).
					<br>
					
					<br><br>2. Python
					<br>What this language is used for:
					<br>• Back end development
					<br>• Data science
					<br>• App development
					
					<br><br>Python is a general-purpose programming language that empowers developers to use several different programming styles (i.e., functional, object-oriented, reflective, etc.) when creating programs. Several popular digital tools and platforms were developed with Python, including YouTube, Google Search and iRobot machines.
					<br>
					
					<br><br>3. HTML
					<br>What this language is used for:
					<br>• Web documents
					<br>• Website development
					<br>• Website maintenance
					
					<br><br>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Don’t let the complicated-sounding name fool you, though; HTML is one of the most accessible stepping stones into the world of programming.
					<br>
					
					<br><br>4. CSS
					<br>What this language is used for:
					<br>• Web documents
					<br>• Website development 
					<br>• Website design
					
					<br><br>CSS, or cascading style sheets, is usually applied in conjunction with HTML and governs the site’s appearance. While HTML organizes site text into chunks, CSS is responsible for determining the size, color and position of all page elements.
					<br>
					
					<br><br>5. Java
					<br>What this language is used for:
					<br>• E-commerce 
					<br>• Finance
					<br>• App development
					
					<br><br>Java is a general use and object-oriented programming language. In object-oriented programming, developers create objects that encompass functions and data, which can then be used to provide structure for programs and applications.
					<br>
					
					<br><br>5. SQL
					<br>What this language is used for:
					<br>• Database management
					<br>• Sales reports
					<br>• Business management
					
					<br><br>SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language that allows programmers to query and manipulate databases. As a domain-specific language, it is designed mainly for managing data within an RDBMS (relational database management system). Put simply, SQL can locate and retrieve data from a database, as well as update, add or remove records.
